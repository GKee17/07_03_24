        <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}> <Text style={{flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap'}}>Last week, I welcomed the new measures announced in the Government’s ‘Plan for Water’, including the investment of around £1.6 billion to reduce sewage discharges and nutrient pollution, and the introduction of unlimited fines for water companies breaking the law. It was great to meet with the new CEO of the Chichester Harbour Conservancy, Matt Briers CBE, and our new Harbour Master, Captain Joanna Cox, on Friday, to talk about these measures in more detail and their priorities for Chichester Harbour and surrounding areas. It was interesting to hear about the work the Conservancy is doing with the Clean Harbours Partnership, and Portsmouth and Brunel Universities to monitor our water quality for additional chemicals that may be present such as pharmaceuticals, microplastics and insecticides. This will run alongside the routine water quality testing carried out every two weeks at 11 sites across the Harbour. I very much look forward to working closely with Matt and Joanna to ensure that we look after, and can all enjoy, our waterways. </View> </p>

        </div> It was a pleasure to catch up with the team St Wilfrid’s Hospice in Bosham, who also welcomed their new CEO, Lois Howell, earlier this year. I have long championed the amazing work the team do to look after people nearing the end of their life or managing terminal conditions whether in the hospice or at home. However, Lois is keen to make sure people know they can visit the hospice for support, at any stage of their illness, to help manage symptoms and maintain their independence at home. The Hospice offers a range of therapeutic activities, exercise classes and one-to-one consultations for patients, as well as support services for family members. So much of this work is possible thanks to their fantastic team of volunteers from those who help deliver care to those working in one of their 12 charity shops and online eBay, Depop and vinted stores, where you can find some great vintage bargains.</p>

        <p>Finally, a massive congratulations to Diana Levantine and team at the Sussex Snowdrop Trust on their 30th anniversary. They are a fantastic charity providing nursing care for children with life-threatening or terminal illnesses in their homes, and respite care and financial support for their families. It was lovely to join their celebration on Friday night and say a massive thank you on behalf of all the families they have helped over the last 30 years.
